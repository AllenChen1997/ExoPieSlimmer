syntax; vX.YZ
X; version of the ExoPieTuples. This will change iff when you make major changes in Tuples and hence skimmer need to be changed significantly. 
YZ; version of the skimmer. With each time you run the skimmer on the condor you need to send the each detail of change you make in the skimmer  in bullets and we can add a tag for it, 

Once you have pushed the code to repository 

create a new tag using: 
git tag v0.00

push the new tag using: 
git push origin v0.00 

v0.00; keeping this as the base tag, electron trigger for 2017 has been changed, using the correct definition as per POG 

v01.00: * added ak8gen jet, 
	* updated b jet regression 
	*  added trigger and filter for mc, 
	* updated Thea correction for 2017 and 18. 
	* This is compatible with v01 of tuples for MC (2017)
	* This is compatible with v02 of tuples for Data  (2017)
